I thank Professor Kamoun for his guidance and advice about the direction of my PhD, as well as for comments and corrections on this manuscript. 
I thank Mark McMullan for every comment and discussion ever made over many informal conversations which helped me develop my own understanding.
Finally, I thank Dr. Matt Clark and his Plant and Microbial Genomics Team at The Genome Analysis Center for welcoming me and providing the best environment I could ask for, in which to work and write up my thesis in my final year.
