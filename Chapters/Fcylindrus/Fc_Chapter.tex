This project was a very large collaboration spanning many years to sequence the genome of the \textit{Fragilariopsis cylindrus} organism.
In order to clearly describe my work and set it in context, some work that was not performed by myself is described.
In particular, any work mentioned in the introduction is not my contribution to the work, but was completed by colleagues.
My contributions to the work are described in sections 4.2.2.1, 4.2.2.2, 4.2.2.3, 4.2.2.4, and the results section presents data that was the outcome of my work only.
In the discussion some further preliminary work is described. A figure showing this work is provided as an appendix, and this work was done jointly and equally between myself and a colleague.
